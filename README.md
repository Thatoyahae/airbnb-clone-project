# airbnb-clone-project
# üìå Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to simulate the functionality of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. It emphasizes backend development, database architecture, API security, and CI/CD integration. This project provides hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative software systems using modern technologies.

# üéØ Project Goals
- Build a robust backend system using Django and MySQL.
- Design a relational database that supports core booking functionalities.
- Implement secure APIs using GraphQL.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Foster collaborative development using GitHub workflows.

# üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

# Key Entities & Fields

1. Users
   - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
   - A user can own multiple properties and make bookings.

2. Properties
   - `id`, `title`, `location`, `description`, `owner_id`
   - Each property is listed by a user and can receive bookings.

3. Bookings
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`
   - A booking links a user to a property for a specific time period.

4. Reviews
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
   - Users can leave reviews for properties they‚Äôve booked.

5. Payments
   - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_method`
   - Payments are tied to bookings and must be securely processed.

# ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

- User Management
  - Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and role-based access.
  - Ensures secure access to platform features based on user roles.

- Property Management
  - Allows users to list, update, and delete properties.
  - Includes image uploads, location tagging, and availability settings.

- **Booking System**
  - Enables users to search for properties and make bookings.
  - Includes date validation, conflict resolution, and booking history.

- **Review System**
  - Users can rate and review properties after their stay.
  - Helps maintain quality and trust across the platform.

- **Payment Integration**
  - Processes secure payments for bookings.
  - Supports multiple payment methods and transaction tracking.

# üîê API Security

# Key Measures

- **Authentication**
  - Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
  - Uses token-based systems like JWT for session management.

- **Authorization**
  - Restricts access based on user roles (e.g., admin vs guest).
  - Prevents unauthorized actions like deleting others‚Äô properties.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Protects APIs from abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
  - Ensures fair usage and system stability.

# Why It Matters
- Protects sensitive user data and financial transactions.
- Maintains trust and reliability in the platform.
- Prevents malicious activities and system overloads.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

# Overview
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the software delivery process. It ensures that code changes are tested, built, and deployed efficiently and reliably.

# Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- **Linting & Testing Suites**: Maintain code quality and catch bugs early.
